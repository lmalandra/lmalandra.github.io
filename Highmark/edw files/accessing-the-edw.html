<td>Before you are able to utilize the EDW, you must request access by submitting a SARA form.  SARA (Security Access Request Application) was developed with the goal of providing ease of use for the requestor.  The initial entry screens allow you to submit a LID or Application ID for which you are requesting access, or you can request access for multiple LIDs by cost center or job title.</td>
