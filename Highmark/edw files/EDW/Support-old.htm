Whenever you need to request support from the Enterprise Data Warehouse, all you need to do is create a EDW Ticket. Depending upon the nature of the issue, a ticket may be resolved within 1 business day. If the issue requires further research and effort to resolve, the ticket will stay open until completion.
<br /><br />
Upon receipt of the submitted EDW Ticket, a Customer Notification email containing the newly created EDW Ticket number and a direct link to that EDW Ticket will be systematically generated to the Customer as confirmation from the Service Center.  Any interim status for this EDW Ticket can be obtained by following the link provided in the email or using the search request process shown below.  Browsing the EDW Ticket Comments tab will provide you with the status and/or action being taken.  Any supplemental information or requests regarding the EDW Ticket should be addressed directly to the EDWMailbox, referencing to the EDW Ticket number assigned.
<br /><br />
<strong>Level I support -</strong> takes the initial action on all EDW Tickets within 1 business day.  The EDW Business Analyst will make every effort to resolve your request within 2 business days of receipt.  Typically these resolvable requests are general information (access related, documentation, training) and data related questions. Once completed, the EDW Ticket will be closed and you will receive a notification of the ticket closing.
<br /><br />
<strong>Level II support -</strong> requests that require more than 8 hours of research can range from completing the research to developing a system's change and may require creating a new EDW EPN System Defect (SD). Once complete, the EDW Ticket will be closed and you will receive a notification.  If an SD is created for additional work, you will be sent a tracking number in the completed EDW Ticket notification and you can request status updates through its final disposition from the EDWMailbox.
<br /><br />

If you need to search for any existing ticket, you may use the <a href="http://getit.highmark.com/getit/e_login_searchQuotesStatusLogin_searchStatus.do">search request</a> link.
<br /><br />
In instances where an EPN System Defect is necessary, another process is followed to create the SD. For complete details on the EDW System Defect Process Flow, view the <a href="http://highwire.highmark.com/sites/iwov/support-files/hwt015/EPN-Process-Guide.doc">EPN Process Guide</a>.
