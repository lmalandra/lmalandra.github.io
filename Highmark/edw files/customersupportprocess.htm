<p><strong>Level I support -</strong> takes the initial action on all Get-It tickets within 1 business day.  The level I analyst will make every effort to resolve your request at this level and within 2 business days of receipt.  Typical Level I resolvable requests are general information (access related, documentation, training) and data related questions.</p>

<p><strong>Level II support -</strong> requests that require more than 8 hours of research are sent to level II support.  Level II requests range from completing research to developing a workaround to creating a new EPN System Defect (SD).  Once complete, the Get-It ticket will be closed and you will receive a notification.  When an SD is created for additional work, you will be sent a tracking number and can expect status updates through its final disposition.</p>
